# Implementation Plan

### Objective

I am building a website for my new client, Urok Logistics https://uroklogistics.com/

UROK Logistics provides comprehensive freight brokerage and logistics services, including full truckload (FTL) shipping, less-than-truckload (LTL) shipping, and third-party logistics (3PL) solutions tailored to help businesses optimize their freight operations with real-time tracking, vetted carriers, and advanced logistics technology across the United States and beyond.

They work with businesses and shippers of all sizes who need reliable, safe, and efficient freight transportation and logistics support. UROK Logistics emphasizes strict carrier vetting for safety and compliance, personalized freight consultations, and technology-driven shipping management to provide peace of mind, streamlined operations, and transparent delivery processes.

The goal of this website is to showcase my client UROK Logistics as a reputable, professional, and effective freight brokerage and logistics partner that a prospective client should work with, and to provide clear CTAs for a prospective client to connect with UROK Logistics about securing tailored shipping and freight management solutions.

### Design

Redesign this landing page to look like it was built by a top-tier design agency charging $50k+. Focus on:

- Refined typography hierarchy with elegant font pairings
- Subtle, sophisticated animations (micro-interactions, smooth transitions)
- A cohesive, premium color palette (avoid anything that feels "template-y")
- Polished details: shadows, gradients, borders that feel intentional and high-end
- Visual rhythm and alignment that feels considered
- Please do animation on every numbers of each page from 0 and count up when it scrolls into view
- Ensure the mobile menu highlights the active page. The Home button should display an active state when the user is on the home page, and the same behavior should apply to all other pages
- Use typography that aligns with the company’s industry and brand identity

The only constraints I'll give you are that you need to use the logo in the navbar that I've attached, use font suited for the modern structure, and use the color theme of the original website. Lastly, if you use any stock photography for the hero section, please make sure it's related to their core services/products

### Copywriting

Take full liberty with the copywriting for this website. In the client's own words, this is how they describe themselves and their services. This information needs to be conveyed in a way that is marketed and comes across well to the user on the website.
